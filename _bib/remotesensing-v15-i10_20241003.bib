ABSTRACT = {Autonomous localization and navigation, as an essential research area in robotics, has a broad scope of applications in various scenarios. To widen the utilization environment and augment domain expertise, simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) in underwater environments has recently become a popular topic for researchers. This paper examines the key SLAM technologies for underwater vehicles and provides an in-depth discussion on the research background, existing methods, challenges, application domains, and future trends of underwater SLAM. It is not only a comprehensive literature review on underwater SLAM, but also a systematic introduction to the theoretical framework of underwater SLAM. The aim of this paper is to assist researchers in gaining a better understanding of the system structure and development status of underwater SLAM, and to provide a feasible approach to tackle the underwater SLAM problem.},
