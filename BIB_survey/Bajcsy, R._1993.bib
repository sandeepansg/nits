abstract="Most past and present work in machine perception has involved extensive static analysis of passively sampled data. However, it should be axiomatic that perception is not passive, but active. Furthermore, most past and current robotics research use rather rigid assumptions, models about the world, objects and their relationships. It is not so difficult to see that these assumptions, most of the time, in realistic situations do not hold, and hence, the robots do not perform to the designer's expectations.",
